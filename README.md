> A data science portfolio project analyzing customer retention patterns in banking

[View the Complete Analysis Notebook](bank_churn_analysis.ipynb)

## Project Overview
This portfolio project explores customer churn prediction using a Kaggle banking dataset of 10,000 customers. The analysis implements various machine learning approaches to understand and predict customer retention patterns, demonstrating practical applications of data science in the banking sector.

## Project Goals
- Implement an end-to-end machine learning workflow
- Compare effectiveness of different modeling approaches
- Extract actionable insights from banking data
- Create informative visualizations for pattern detection

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed several significant patterns:
- Age emerged as the strongest predictor of customer churn
- Number of products per customer significantly impacts retention
- Optimized Random Forest model achieved 85% accuracy with balanced class prediction
- Visualizations uncovered clear patterns in customer behavior

## Technical Implementation
The project follows a structured analytical approach:
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees
- Feature engineering for model optimization
- Strategic insights development
